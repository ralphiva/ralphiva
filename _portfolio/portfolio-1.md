## About Paper Walls

In a crumbling city where borders are weapons and hope is contraband, you are the invisible hand deciding who is granted entry, and who is left to vanish.  
Stamp approvals. Reject strangers. Watch the walls rise.  
But when whispers slip past your desk â€” whispers of corruption, injustice, and lives worth saving, you must choose: obey the system, or tear it apart one decision at a time.

Every stamp is a life.  
Every hesitation is a crack in the wall.

**Paper Walls** is a choice-driven narrative game about surveillance, loyalty, and the slow erosion of humanity under bureaucracy.  
Your actions will determine not just the fate of others â€” but your own survival.

## Developerâ€™s Note

Paper Walls was born from my deep interest in immigration research and the human stories hidden behind systems of control. Inspired by real-world case processing, border surveillance, and the bureaucratic pressures faced by migrants and officers alike, this project explores how small decisions inside institutions can have massive, irreversible effects on people's lives.  
Through this game, I wanted to invite players to confront the emotional weight of choices that often remain invisible, to question what it means to follow orders, where compassion fits in, and how power can quietly reshape morality. At its core, Paper Walls is not just a story about borders, itâ€™s about the unseen walls we build, and the quiet cracks that might one day bring them down.

<h2>About Bibliocircuitry</h2>

<p><strong>Bibliocircuitry</strong> is a mixed media project built around a short religious comic distributed through direct mail by a Christian organization.  
The original publication presents contemporary global crises, including inflation, war, and widespread mental health struggles, and frames religious faith as the singular solution to societal and personal chaos.  
It draws a clear moral line between fear, anger, and salvation, guiding readers toward a specific ideological conclusion.</p>

<p>In response, I modified the magazine materially and electronically to question and destabilize its narrative flow.  
By embedding a simple LED circuit triggered by pressing an angry figure, and by physically altering select panels through cuts and reassemblies, the project highlights how emotional responses are constructed, amplified, and directed by seemingly "natural" storytelling techniques.</p>

<p>Through these modifications, <strong>Bibliocircuitry</strong> invites viewers to reconsider how printed materials guide emotional responses, and how small interventions can destabilize seemingly fixed narratives of fear, control, and redemption.</p>

# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m **Ralph**, a Graduate Student at the **University of Alberta** pursuing a Master of Arts in **Digital Humanities**. My work explores how emerging technologies shape culture, identity, and systems of powerâ€”especially in the realms of **video game studies**, **immigration**, and **social media activism**.

Currently, I serve as a **Research Assistant** investigating software tools used in immigration case processing in Canada. This project has opened up deeper insights into the implications of automation, surveillance, and decision-making in bureaucratic systems. I'm also affiliated with the [Bridging Divides](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/bridgingdividesuofa/home) initiative through my supervising professor, which focuses on understanding digital systems and inequalities.

## ðŸŽ® Research Interests

My academic work is driven by a passion for digital culture and narrative design. Iâ€™m particularly interested in:

- **Long-form storytelling in video games** and how emotional immersion creates deeper player experiences  
- **Design fiction and speculative interfaces** used to critique or reimagine socio-technical systems  
- **The politics of data**â€”how metadata, algorithms, and user interactions become part of larger cultural narratives  
- **Migration technologies** and how governments use software to mediate access, identity, and control  

Digital Humanities, to me, is the perfect space to blend theory with creative experimentationâ€”where databases, narrative, code, and design come together to tell stories that matter.

## âœ¨ Professional Background

Before grad school, I earned my undergraduate degree in **Communication**. That background shaped how I analyze media, craft arguments, and understand the nuances of interpersonal and public communication.  

As a **freelancer**, I wear many hats:

- **Copywriter** â€” Iâ€™ve developed content for brands, academic groups, and online platforms  
- **Video Editor** â€” Skilled in DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, and other tools, I edit short-form content, promos, and academic explainers  
- **Graphic Designer** â€” With experience in Canva, Illustrator, and Photoshop, I create everything from social media assets to pitch decks and visual identity kits

These skills let me bridge academic work and real-world communicationâ€”translating complex ideas into engaging visual and textual formats.

## ðŸ“š Undergraduate Foundations

Hereâ€™s a little throwback to how I described myself during my undergraduate years:

> As a communication enthusiast, I possess a keen understanding of the intricacies of human interaction and expression. My education equipped me with skills in public speaking, media analysis, and rhetoric. I learned to craft compelling messages, structure persuasive arguments, and adapt communication strategies across different contexts. My vision was (and still is) to harness the power of speech and media to create meaningful connections and drive positive change.

## ðŸ’¡ Current Goals

At this point in my academic and professional journey, Iâ€™m focused on:

- Publishing work that bridges research and design  
- Building projects that explore emotional mapping in games and speculative futures  
- Collaborating with researchers, creatives, and developers  
- Remaining critically engaged with the tools we use, the stories we tell, and the systems we build  

Iâ€™m especially interested in how emotional data is collected, represented, and interpreted in digital spacesâ€”and how this affects our sense of self and community.

## ðŸ“« Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m always open to conversations, collaborations, and shared explorationsâ€”whether itâ€™s about game narratives, research ethics in tech, or storytelling across media.  

If you're working on a project or just want to chat about ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
